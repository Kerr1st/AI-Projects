I've found the logs from your Amazon Q CLI session where you created the Amazon 
Q Developer Prompt Flow document yesterday! The logs are stored in:

/Users/kerrfir/Library/Application Support/amazon-q/history

Looking at the file, I can see the command history from your CLI sessions, 
including the session where you created the Amazon Q Developer Prompt Flow 
document. Here's what I found:

1. The Amazon Q CLI stores its history in a different location than the VSCode 
extension:
   • CLI history: /Users/kerrfir/Library/Application Support/amazon-q/history
   • VSCode extension history: /Users/kerrfir/.aws/amazonq/history/

2. The CLI history shows that yesterday (May 6th), you:
   • Used the q chat command multiple times
   • Generated a diagram at 
/Users/kerrfir/generated-diagrams/amazon_q_prompt_flow.png.png
   • Created the AmazonQ.md file that's now in your 
/Users/kerrfir/Amazon Q Repositories/AI-Projects/ directory

3. The specific commands related to the Amazon Q Developer Prompt Flow document 
include:
  

   - command: q chat
     exit_code: 0
     shell: zsh
     session_id: fc6b8bee5fc440068c84a065c4091fba
     cwd: /Users/kerrfir/Amazon Q Repositories/movie-repository/python
     time: 1746577527
   


  And later:
  

   - command: open "/Users/kerrfir/generated-diagrams/amazon_q_prompt_flow.png.png"
     exit_code: 0
     shell: zsh
     session_id: fb6f1123221b4e3b8dfdb1c42fa69b0a
     cwd: /Users/kerrfir/Amazon Q Repositories/movie-repository/python/generated-diagrams
     time: 1746578316
   


The CLI history file contains the commands you executed but not the actual 
conversation content. The Amazon Q CLI appears to store the actual chat content 
in a SQLite database at:

/Users/kerrfir/Library/Application Support/amazon-q/data.sqlite3

This database likely contains the full conversation where you created the Amazon
Q Developer Prompt Flow document, but accessing its contents would require 
using SQLite tools to query the database.

The document itself (AmazonQ.md) and the diagram (amazon_q_prompt_flow.png.png) 
were both created yesterday, confirming that this was the session where you 
built the Amazon Q Developer Prompt Flow.
